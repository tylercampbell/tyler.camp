# {{ title }}

Hi together my name is Tim Keiner (=nobody in english ;)) and I'm a passionate developer and this is the first time that I'm really created my own blog publishing system.

## Goals

> I know that I know nothing

The longer I code, the more I understand this [quote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_that_I_know_nothing). Since I got a lot of knowledge from a varienty of blogs I want to give something back and maybe you'll find some useful pieces for your work on this page.

Since I'm also interested in all kinds of _new_ web technologies, I'll use this page as personal playground to investigate in new technologies.

## Credits

I thought a very long time about making a Blog and some contents I enjoyed recently let me take this step. I think it was a combination of two episodes of the [Working Draft Podcast ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª](https://workingdraft.de):

- [Revision 433: Eleventy](https://workingdraft.de/433/)

  This episode introduces [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) to me which seems to be a perfects match for my goals. I worked with [Hogu](https://gohugo.io/) (page development and content authoring for [Sakulis landing page](sakuli.io) and [Sakulis docs](sakuli.io/docs)) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (just authoring content for [ConSol Labs](https://labs.consol.de/)). While both projects are very nice page generators, I encountered some problems in terms of the flexibility. 11ty is written and configured via JavaScript which I can adapt and utilize while getting all the nice features of a _lightweight_ static page generator. Also the inspiring words from [@ddprrt](https://twitter.com/ddprrt) and [his brilliant blog](https://fettblog.eu/) motivated me to start.

- [Revision 435: Open, Decentralized, Federated und Indie](https://workingdraft.de/435/)

  The idea back to an open and decentralized web inspired me build this page with this mindset. After some research i found this the _mini series_ about indieweb implementations with 11ty ([Part 1](https://mxb.dev/blog/syndicating-content-to-twitter-with-netlify-functions/) [Part 2](https://mxb.dev/blog/using-webmentions-on-static-sites/)) by [Max BÃ¶ck](https://twitter.com/mxbck).
